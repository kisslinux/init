    # adamantium dylanaraps: I heard the way we "seed random" is not
    #            actually doing anything
    # adamantium cat /var/random.seed > /dev/urandom
    # adamantium Anyone know if this actually works?/
    # dylanaraps You can try 'cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail'
    #            right after boot.
    # dylanaraps > It is also possible to write to /dev/random. This allows
    #              any user to mix random data into the pool.
    # dylanaraps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random
    # dylanaraps I don't know if this also applies to /dev/urandom.
    # dylanaraps I'll look for a source on this.
    # dylanaraps > Writing to /dev/random or /dev/urandom will update the
    #              entropy pool with the data written, but this will not
    #              result in a higher entropy count. This means that it
    #              will impact the contents read from both files, but it
    #              will not make reads from /dev/random faster.
    # dylanaraps > ... This differs from writing to /dev/random or
    #              /dev/urandom, which only adds some data but does not
    #              increment the entropy count.
    # dylanaraps https://linux.die.net/man/4/urandom
    # dylanaraps Also, this page shows how to seed the generator and it is
    #            exactly the same method we use.
    # dylanaraps (Though we hardcode the pool size)
    # dylanaraps If you're wondering why the pool size is hardcoded:
    #            https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Random_number_generation
    # dylanaraps > While Linux kernel 2.4 did have writable /proc entries
    #              for controlling the entropy pool size, in newer kernels
    #              only read_wakeup_threshold and write_wakeup_threshold
    #              are writable. The pool size is now hardcoded in kernel
    #              line 275 of /drivers/char/random.c
    # dylanaraps > The kernel's pool size is given by
    #              INPUT_POOL_WORDS * OUTPUT_POOL_WORDS which makes, as
    #              already stated, 4096 bits.
    # dylanaraps 4096 bits = 512 bytes (What we set it to)
    # dylanaraps We use /dev/urandom over /dev/random so as to not block
    #            during boots. It was announced today that /dev/random in
    #            upcoming kernels won't block either so we'll eventually
    #            swap to it.
    # dylanaraps The kernel for 4 years has actually seeded /dev/urandom
    #            itself in addition to our seeding (see this kernel commit):
    #            e192be9d9a30555aae2ca1dc3aad37cba484cd4a
    # dylanaraps This whole process is a fickle mess of conflicting and
    #            unclear information so if we are doing this wrongly I'd
    #            like to fix it.
    # dylanaraps If you have any experience here it'd be appreciated. :)
    # dylanaraps The kernel also warns about reading /dev/urandom without
    #            entropy. https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9173499/
    # adamantium Got it. dylanaraps I kniw nothing about this subject.
    #            fickle mess it is, then.
    # dylanaraps Yup...
    # dylanaraps Where did you hear about our seeding process possibly not
    #            working?
    # adamantium Just a person in  #emacs who was looking at my elisp
    #            rewrite of it
    # adamantium I think he is a knowledgable person, though, but from what
    #            you shared, I think he's probably wrong
    # dylanaraps Systemd works the same more or less.
    # dylanaraps See: systemd/src/random-seed/random-seed.c
    # dylanaraps It also writes to /dev/urandom.
    # adamantium cool
    # dylanaraps All non-systemd distributions do it using our method or
    #            similar.
    # adamantium So does systemE
    # adamantium =)
    # dylanaraps heh
